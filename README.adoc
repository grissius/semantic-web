= Semantic web and linked data
Jaroslav Šmolík <smolijar@fit.cvut.cz>

== Semestral project
For the project I selected Czech language words.
I will combine words from dictionary with word frequencies in natural language and word tagging, using Wiktionary XML dumps.

=== Datasets

As mentioned before I will use 3 datasets.

. Hunspell Czech dictionary
. Czech Wiktionary XML dump containing additional word information (part of speech, ethymology, ...)
. Word frequencies gathered from OpenSubtitles
